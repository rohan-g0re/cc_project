so just to clarify and correct you a little - we have 5 steps

1. a trigger which gets activated after the pdf is added in bucket
2. IndexPdfLambda lmabda which downloads the pdfs and extracts text ONLY
3. Second lambda first creates a s3 vecotr bucket, then does this in loop:
    3.1 chunks the extracted text into fixed sized
    3.2 vectorizes it using bedrock
    3.3 pushes them into bucket  

- we need to select how to store metadata --> but before selecting also tell me - you said that raw text can be stored as metadata but it is very limited - how small are we talking  


4. QueryRagLambda
    - it ONLY recieves query string in natural language
    - it vectorizes it using the same bedrock model earlier used
    - it then initiates the search in the s3 vectors bucket and calculates the cosine similarity returns the top k vectors
    - BASED ON WHAT WE CHOSE FOR STEP 3 - we retrieve the metadata for those k chunks, which is ONLY THE RAW TEXT (nothing else)

    - these raw texts and the actual question should be stored and given to the next lambda

5. this lambda is responsible for folling things:
    - INPUT: json of actual question, raw texts of all top k vectors
    - TASKS:
        - create a prompt and a gemini client and tell it to answer this 
        - parse the response correctly from gemini and log it

<Task>

1. Check everything
2. need metdata clarification for step 3 

</Task>

just to inform you that I did the decoupling of second lambda into query lambda and gemini lambda bcoz later for the actual application we would need to add a few more things in lamda which might be overloading a single lambda 







# 2

I AM NEW TO AWS and dont know anything about it - JUST CREATED AN AWS account -->  I have completed Phase 1 of this plan and attached its documentation below

Lets start with the PHASE 2 of implementation -->

******
<ADMIN_COMMANDS>

- For a phase give me tasks so that the advancement is more manageable
- For every task: give a few cases which I need to check and inform you the results before we move to the next task
- Give ultra_detailed navigation instructions accross AWS console for every task and help me understand why we are doing what we are doing 

</ADMIN_COMMANDS>
