## Comments

- Similar to the lambda 1 - AWS does not natively have ```google-generativeai``` package
- But during creating the layer it was constanlty keeping on creating ARM compiled binary files (bcoz I use an ARM laptop) even though I used WSL.
- So we are nomore using that package - BUT -  we will beusing gemini api directly over HTTP

## Environment variables for this lambda

```
1. GEMINI_MODEL
2. GEMINI_SECRET_NAME
```
